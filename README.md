# machine-learning

- Basics of machine learning, understading the decision tree, tree defth, leaf nodes 
- Loading csv data using Panda, understanding data using describe and head methods of panda 
- Building first Model, Chooing Feaures (know data used for prediction) and Target (the value to predict)  Defining a model, Fitting a model, Predict, Evaulate (using sklearn lib. of python)
- Validating the models, introdution to Mean Absolute Error (MEA- diff b/w the acutal and predicted values from the training data set), introduction to train_test_split - splitting the given data into training data and data set for prediction so that we can compare the results
- Underfitting and overfitting concepts based on Shallow and Deep trees respectively. In underfitting we ignore a lot of features while in overfitting the issue is we have large splits that results in less number of records to predict 
- Introduction to Random Forest (RandomForestRegressor) to overcomes the problem of underfitting and overfitting resulting in better model selection. Provided by sklearn lib. itself 

## While Choosing a better model can be quite a task, There are Google and AWS services that offer AutoML that decide the better models automatically and we just use them for predection pretty straight forward.
